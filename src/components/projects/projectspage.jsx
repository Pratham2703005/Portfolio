Using React and Tailwind CSS for the front-end, it integrates Google Earth Engine for image retrieval and Leaflet for mapping and displaying segmented features. I created API endpoints to process the segmentation and enable users to export results in GeoJSON and KML formats for further analysis. Additionally, I utilized React Joyride to build interactive guided tours, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience across devices.",
